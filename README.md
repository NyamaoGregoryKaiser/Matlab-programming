# Matlab-programming
This is a repository containing Matlab solutions for various plots.
1. Plot a polygon named t with coordinates;  (8,7) (12,28) (34,28) (63,7)
Perform the following translations on t
 
2. Translate t by (-20,2). Name the resultant polygon t1
3. Scale t by a factor of 2. Name the resultant polygon t2
4. Scale t by (2,1). Name the resultant polygon t3
5. Rotate t by 30 degrees about the origin. Name the resultant polygon t4
6.  Rotate t by 45 degrees about the point (23,7). Name the resultant polygon t5
7. Use the rotate command on t and plot the output. Animate the effect.

N/B: Label all the graphs by the title of the transformation e.g “Rotation by 30 degrees about the origin” Plot all resultant polygons alongside the original polygon(t)
The animation is saved in an mp4 video file
